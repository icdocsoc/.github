# Department of Computing Society (DoCSoc)

DoCSoc is run by DoC students of Imperial College London, for DoC students (and for anyone interested in computing!), all to make your time at Imperial as enjoyable and rewarding as we can. Get involved!

To keep you on your toes, we run tons of tech talks from the likes of Meta, Bloomberg, Google, Palantir, and more. In the past weâ€™ve hosted talks and workshops centred around machine learning, blockchain technology and sentiment analysis, to name a few examples. We also host workshops centred around learning particular technologies such as Docker or React Native.

Or join us at our annual flagship hackathon, IC Hack, where the best innovators from Imperial and beyond gather to build some extremely cool tech, all in 24 hours. If free sponsor merch, food from the likes Nando's, Dominos, and more, or random karaoke sessions are not enough, we don't know what is!
